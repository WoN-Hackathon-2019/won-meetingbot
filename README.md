# Meeting-Bot
This Bot can be integrated in order to find an adequate location for meeting up. Given two locations (the locations of the interaction partners) we find you a venue for a meeting near the halfway point between you. 

How-To-Use (JSON):
1. start chat with the bot
2. write a message in the following form: /json "lat1,lng1;lat2,lng2;..;latN,lngN/<category>"
3. the bot writes a message back with a stringified json object containing the data of the found venue

category: pick a category from https://developer.foursquare.com/docs/resources/categories (english)
